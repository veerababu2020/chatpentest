Because cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities are always evolving, new approaches to standard penetration testing processes are required. This script analyses the interplay of cutting-edge technologies, namely the coupling of well-known penetration testing tools, Nmap, Metasploit, Whois, and Msfvenom, with the Large Language Model (LLM) known as ChatGPT, which is built on the openai API design. The resultant technique is a fresh approach to penetration testing, using natural language comprehension and generating skills to improve different phases of the testing process. 
Note - before using scripts you should change your chatgpt api key with your own key
